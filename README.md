# fCC_Quality-Assurance
Here are some of my "Quality Assurance" Projects on freeCodeCamp

## 1. Metric-Imperial Converter
- **Introduction**: Because it is the first project, the investment time is quite large. But it also brings me a lot of joy at midnight, XD.
- **Skills**: NodeJS, Express, Chai, Mocha.
- **Purposes**: Perform Metric Imperial conversion back and forth from input data.

## 2. Issue-Tracker
- **Introduction**: Through this project, I learned how to run mongoDB on localhost. And especially, it's more difficult and time-consuming than I thought.
- **Skills**: NodeJS, Express, Chai, Mocha, MongoDB, Mongoose.
- **Purposes**: Manage issues in a project, including creating, updating, deleting, and filtering issues.

## 3. Personal-Library
- **Introduction**: This project is much more comfortable than the previous one. It helps me master the basics better

## 4. Sudoku Solver

## 5. American British Translator
